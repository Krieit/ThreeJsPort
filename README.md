## Starting out

This widget allows minting NFTs on your website. 

To start, you need an Ethereum NFT contract. [Create it via Buildship app](https://app.buildship.xyz), or test with an [example contract](https://github.com/buildship-dev/webflow-nft-components#example-for-testing).

**MetaverseNFT** contract by [buildship.xyz](https://buildship.xyz) is used by **40+** collections with **1000ETH+** in total volume.
It features **40% lower** mint gas fees, costs **~100$ in gas to deploy**, bullet-proof security and extensions like presale lists, mint passes, etc.


## How to use?
1. Open Webflow website editor
2. Create a new [Embedded HTML code](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-embed) block (at least **Basic** site plan required)
3. Copy & paste this code in Webflow Embed block
```html
<script>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE"
   IS_TESTNET = false
   MAX_PER_MINT = 20
   // if your contract is NOT VERIFIED on Etherscan
   // put here: CONTRACT_ABI = [{...}]
   // don't do anything if unsure
</script>
<script src="https://nftcomponents.vercel.app/static/js/main.js"></script>
<link href="https://nftcomponents.vercel.app/static/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
4. If you **have your Ethereum NFT contract**

   âœ… insert your contract address in `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` field 
   
   âœ… set `IS_TESTNET` to `false` or `true` depending on which network is the contract on: `Ethereum Mainnet` or `Rinkeby Testnet`.
   

If you **don't have a contract**, [create it via Buildship app](https://app.buildship.xyz)

> Your contract should be [verified](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract) on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io). Otherwise you have to add `CONTRACT_ABI = [{...}]` line in the above code, with your full contract ABI inserted. If you have an error saying your ABI is too long, [click here](https://github.com/buildship-dev/webflow-nft-components/issues/22#issuecomment-1042708174).

6. Create a button with ID `mint-button` on your Webflow site

<!-- <img src="public/images/webflow-id.png" width="200" /> -->

On the left side, press Add and find Button

Select your button, then on the right side, set Button id to `mint-button`

<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909384/166176251-c0c5f981-2cab-40ac-b7d8-5a5d7c297987.png">

If you can't set an ID, you can set a button URL as `mint-button` or `https://<your-website-url>/#mint-button`

7. You're done ðŸŽ‰

## FAQ

### I'm confused / it's not working, can you help me?
Yes, absolutely! You can [contact us in Discord](http://buildship.xyz/), or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/buildship-dev/webflow-nft-components/issues/new)

### How to add "Connect wallet" button?
Mint button will ask to connect wallet, so it's not necessary to add a "Connect wallet" button.

If you still want to do it, create a Webflow button with ID `connect`.

### How to add a custom minted counter?
Just create two text elements and assign them:
- `minted-counter` ID to display minted number
- `total-counter` ID to display collection size

### How to use this with Polygon, Binance, or other Ethereum-based networks?
It's easy! Set `NETWORK_ID` instead of `IS_TESTNET` in the code snippet

```html
<script>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE"
   NETWORK_ID = 1
   // remove IS_TESTNET line
   ...
</script>
<script ...>
<link ...>
```

Some of the network IDs you might use:
- Ethereum Mainnet: `NETWORK_ID = 1`
- Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet: `NETWORK_ID = 4`
- Polygon: `NETWORK_ID = 137`
- Binance: `NETWORK_ID = 56`
- For other IDs visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org)

### How to style minting dialog?
[See the example here](https://github.com/buildship-dev/webflow-nft-components/wiki/Mint-button-widget#how-to-style-minting-dialog)

### How to hide minted counter from the dialog?
You need to set `DEFAULTS.hideCounter` to `true`
```html
<script>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE"
   NETWORK_ID = 1
   DEFAULTS = {
       hideCounter: true
   }
   ...
</script>
<script ...>
<link ...>
```

### What's all available customization?
Here's a list of all available parameters for customization. If you need help with this, message us in Discord
```html
<script>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE"
   CONTRACT_ABI = []                   // needed for non-verified contracts only
   NETWORK_ID = 4                      // defaults to 1: Ethereum network
   IS_TESTNET = true                   // true defaults to 4: Rinkeby network
   MAX_PER_MINT = 5                    // max value of NFT quantity slider in the modal, default is 20
   DEFAULTS = {
      labels: {
          walletConnected: "Wallet connected", // label for wallet connected button
      },
      hideCounter: false,              // hide minted counter from the dialog. Default: true
      contractMethods: {
         mint: "myCustomMintMethod"    // defaults to "mint" or "publicMint"
      },
      publicMint: {
          price: 0.1                    // defaults to none, fetched automatically from smart-contract
      }
   }
   STYLES = {
      theme: "light",
      backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
      primaryColor: "#2986CC",
      primaryTextColor: "#1f1f1f",
      secondaryTextColor: "#9e9e9e",
      buttonTextColor: "#ffffff",
      corners: "rounded"
   }
</script>
```

### Do you collect any data?
Anonymous data collected using Amplitude, so we can know how many users the widget has. The only thing we collect is website URL.
If you want to opt out, set 

```html
<script>
...
DEFAULTS = { 
   analyticsOptOut: true
}
...
</script>
```
